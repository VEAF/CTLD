# CTLD Next — Release Testing Procedure

Testing is organized in six levels (L1 to L6).
L1 and L2 run automatically via GitHub Actions CI.
L3 to L5 require a live DCS session with the dcs-bridge Lua bridge injected and `dcs-serve` running.
L6 is purely manual (player + checklist).

Every L3–L5 scenario also carries a `-- @tier:` header (`auto` / `auto-check` / `ia`) marking
whether it needs an AI agent or human in the loop at all. Most of L3 (`noPlayer/`) is `auto` or
`auto-check` and can be **driven headlessly** by `tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py`
instead of injecting each script by hand — see [Automation tiers](#automation-tiers) below.

For debug configuration and CTLD.log setup, see [Building & testing](developer/building-and-testing.md).

## Folder to level mapping

| Folder | Level | Execution context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/ci/unit/` | L1 | GitHub Actions — busted, no DCS |
| `tests/ci/functional/` | L2 | GitHub Actions — busted, no DCS |
| `tests/dcs/noPlayer/` | L3 | Developer local — DCS + dcs-bridge, no player slot |
| `tests/dcs/pilotPassive/` | L4 | Developer local — DCS + player in cockpit, script drives |
| `tests/dcs/pilotActive/` | L5 | Developer local — DCS + player takes F10 actions |
| `tests/manual_test_sequences.md` | L6 | Developer local — player, step-by-step checklist |

---

## Automation tiers

Independently of the L-level (which folder a scenario lives in), every scenario carries a
`-- @tier:` header telling you (or the runner) whether it needs an AI agent/human at all:

| Tier | Meaning | Can run headless? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` | A single injection returns the definitive verdict (`PASS`/`FAIL`/`ABORT`). No player, no polling, no judgment call. | Yes |
| `auto-check` | Resolves automatically via a real timer/`waitFor` or a re-injected step machine, within seconds — the scenario returns `STARTED`/`RUNNING` and the runner polls/re-injects `_SCN_<ID>_RESULT` until it resolves. No human/AI judgment. | Yes (fast) |
| `auto-slow` | No human either, but needs **minutes of real AI-unit flight** to resolve (an AI helicopter flying a route to a pickup/dropoff zone). Excluded from the fast `--no-ai` sweep; run explicitly with `--tier auto-slow --poll-timeout 900`, player just parked in a slot. | Yes (slow, on demand) |
| `ia` | Needs a human: either a live player who must **fly** (`ia (fly)`) or one who must **click an F10 item / make a visual judgment** the code never checks (`ia (menu)`). dcs-bridge has no flight-control API. | No |

The `pilotActive/`/`pilotPassive/` folders do **not** imply `ia` — the tier reflects what a
scenario's code actually needs, checked per file, not its folder. A `CATCH-UP-PILOT-SCENARIOS`
audit found that of the ~34 scenarios once blanket-tagged `ia`, only a handful truly need a human
(two menu-visual `ia (fly)` checks, plus one deferred and one optional-manual); the large
majority drive AI helicopters or self-verify and are `auto-check`/`auto-slow`. See the
`integration-testing` skill for the full taxonomy and how each template defaults.

### Running `auto`/`auto-check` scenarios headlessly

`tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py` (dependency-free Python, no install step) discovers
scenarios, filters by tier/folder/name, drives them over `dcs-serve`'s REST API, polls async
ones, and writes a JUnit report:

```bash
# Everything L3 needs a player for is skipped automatically
python tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py --no-ai --inject-ctld

# Just the scenarios covering one module
python tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py --scenario F-178
```

This replaces manually injecting each L3a/L3b file one by one (still useful for a quick targeted
check while iterating). See `tools/integration-runner/README.md` for the full flag reference.
L4/L5 (`ia`) still require the manual/AI-driven injection loop described below.

## Release order

```text
Modify src/
    |
[LOCAL] L3 noPlayer  -- inject relevant F-xxx + scenario_* for modified module
    | (PASS)
[LOCAL] L4 pilotPassive  -- if feature touches player flow (menus, spawns, effects)
    | (PASS)
[LOCAL] L5 pilotActive  -- if feature modifies an F10 menu visible to the player
    | (PASS, or skip if not applicable)
git push  ->  CI L1/L2 runs automatically
    | (CI green)
PR  ->  merge to master
    |
git tag vX.Y  ->  CI Release job builds and publishes CTLD.lua
```

> **Rule:** L3 to L5 must pass **before** the push. CI (L1/L2) uses DCS stubs and cannot
> detect real-DCS regressions. A green CI with a failing L3 means the code is broken
> without CI knowing it.
>
> **Exception:** documentation, comments, non-functional refactors may be pushed without L3 to L5.

## L1 — CI busted unit (automatic)

**Who:** GitHub Actions.
**When:** every push to `master` or `feature_*`, every PR.
**Scripts:** `tests/ci/unit/*_spec.lua` — 21 files, ~105 tests.
**Runner:** `busted tests/ci/` (Job 3 in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

Scope: Config, EventDispatcher, Zones, Crates, Troops, JTAC, Menu, Utils, i18n, ModValidator.
All DCS API calls replaced by stubs in `tests/ci/helpers/dcs_stubs.lua`.

---

## L2 — CI busted functional (automatic)

**Who:** GitHub Actions.
**When:** same triggers as L1.
**Scripts:** `tests/ci/functional/*_spec.lua` — 8 files, ~45 tests.

---

## L3 — DCS noPlayer (developer, before push)

**Who:** developer.
**When:** before every push that modifies `src/`.
**How:** inject scripts into a running DCS mission. No player slot required.

> Most of L3 is `auto`/`auto-check` tier and can run headlessly via
> `tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py --no-ai` (see [Automation tiers](#automation-tiers))
> instead of injecting the files below by hand.

**When:** before push, only when F10 menu structure or visibility changes.

| Scenario | What the player must do |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario_crate_menu_sol_vol_visual.lua` | Confirm Crate Commands menu on ground / in flight / after landing |
| `scenario_troop_menu_sol_vol_visual.lua` | Confirm Troop Commands menu on ground / in flight / after landing |

---

## L6 — Manual sequences (developer, new features only)

Step-by-step checklists in `tests/manual_test_sequences.md`. No script — pure observation.

| Sequence | Feature | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MT-01 | Multi-group troop transport + disembark menu | Any troop transport change |
| MT-02 | Whole-vehicle load / unload / parachute | Vehicle transport change |
| MT-03 | Multi-vehicle load / unload / parachute | Vehicle capacity or multi-load change |
| MT-06 | RECON FARP/FOB layer | RECON or CTLDStaticWatcher change |

## Pre-release checklist

Before tagging `vX.Y`:

- [ ] All CI jobs green on `master` (lint, build, busted).
- [ ] Any new `src/` file added to `tools/build/listToMerge.txt`.
- [ ] L3 passed — `python tools/integration-runner/run_scenarios.py --no-ai` (or targeted
      per-module injection) for all modules modified since last tag.
- [ ] L4 passed for all player-visible features modified since last tag.
- [ ] L5 passed if any F10 menu structure changed.
- [ ] `tests/recette.md` updated (new rows + coverage summary).
- [ ] `migration/MODERNIZATION-PLAN.md` feature statuses up to date.
- [ ] `docs/pilot/` and `docs/mission-maker/` updated if any user-visible behavior changed.
